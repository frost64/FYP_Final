If game/application is installing when you are not using internet  then the mobile service provider is doing the instal and Balance cut without your knowledge. For this the mobile should not be blamed. The only options are complain to the service provider or change the service provider.\\n \\r\\n2. If game/application/software is downloading and installing while you are browsing the internet then it is possible that the website you are visiting is accidently or deliberately downloading the software. Many unscrupulous website download free apps or games as they want more and more users. Such downloads will not result in balance cut. You can usually see the download of the app/game in the download option of your browser. \\n \\r\\n3. If app/game gets downloaded when using browser and balance gets cut  then it means that the website you are visiting has links to the app/game which you have accidentally or deliberately clicked (touched) this problem is most in touch phones. Even if you are trying to scroll the Webpage and there are links there  it may get clicked even if that was not what you wanted.\\n \\r\\nTips: 1. Donot use any browser for a few days and see if apps still get downloaded. If yes then daily is with service provider. Complain or change service provider. \\r\\n2. When apps get installed  check sms. If there is a sms  then probably you accidently clicked a link on some webpage. Donot blindly go to any webpage via search engines or links.\\n \\r\\nHope this helps. \\n', 'Manoj  25 Jan 2017In my phone  some softwares are installed automatically when i connect internet.

I am using this phone since 3 months.\\n \\r\\n1. Fragile \\r\\nIt fell off 2-3 times(not from a great height)and got physically damaged to an extent. So you can imagine how cheap is the build quality of this phone and you can also anticipate the durability of this phone.\\n \\r\\n2. Poor battery backup \\r\\nBattery backup is worst.Even after lowering brightness screen timeout and other things battery performance remains below average.\\n \\r\\n3. Substandard Camera \\r\\nComparing to the megapixels(8mp)  Camera quality is substandard(Micromax would be a much more better option in this budget).\\n \\r\\n4. Very poor sound quality \\r\\nThe sound is too low without earphones. Alarm volume too is very low(you wont be able to wake up also)\\n \\r\\n5. No resale value \\r\\nThis brand has no resale value. After 2-3 months of usage you hardly get 2-3k for your 10k phone. Considering this aspect  you should go for samsung.\\n \\r\\n6. Display problem within 6 months of usage  \\r\\nWithin 6 months of usage  I saw green lines on the display screen. When removed the battery of the phone and switched it on  it got struck on the xolo logo and didn't start only.\\n \\r\\n7.Heating Issue  \\r\\nThe phone gets heated up easily and quickly(with normal usage). How confortably can you use a phone which gets heated up within ashort span of time?\\n \\r\\n8. Worst after-sale service \\r\\nWorst would be an understatement for the after-sale service provided by the company. The people at the service centre(in Mumbai) are too rude. Moreover  they dont provide you the spare parts of the phone. In case your phone gets physically damaged you cannot fix the issue which means It would be a 'Dead end' \\n \\r\\n9. Quality always comes at a price  \\r\\nLast but not the least if you want a phone with quality and durability  then surely this is not the brand you should go for. (go for samsung/sony/lg/htc instead)\", 'xolo q900t battery removable or not', 'i am using the phone more than 4 months...now got hanged most of the time and data connection is connecting automatically even though auto sync in disabled mode. can you pls suggest what can i do further.

Display 8/10 \\r\\nIts an ips & it have good viewing angle & color reproduction. Best in similar priced ones \\r\\n4. Vedio playback 7/10 \\r\\nCan handle 720p smoothly but 1080p lags  \\r\\nBut thats ok even galaxy core. Or quattro cant play 1080p \\r\\n5.gaming 8/10 \\r\\nIt can play aphsalt 8 in medium quality. \\r\\nI never expected this frm a phone at this price range \\r\\nIt can install apps & games to sd card so memory is not a problem\\n \\r\\nCons \\r\\n1.battery life 6/10 \\r\\nIt won't last a day  \\r\\nwhen using 3g battery drains very fast\\n\\n \\r\\nVerdict \\r\\nOverall value for money \\r\\nGo for it if your budget is around 7k \\r\\nIts better than galaxy sdous  & core  & grand quattro \\r\\nOnly phone which beats this is lumia 520 525 & xperia m\"]",

And screen is very hard to see from an angle or in strong light. Otherwise good. Despite using android 5.1  seems all apps in December 2018 install well.\", \"The phone can be rooted  did it now in August 2017.\\n \\r\\nThe method used was to run from PC with latest Windows 10 (likely also works with earlier versions  but program might crash on some computers). Via USB run the trial program from renewandroidcom. It failed to root  but this doesn't matter  important that it runs until it says failure or success.\\n \\r\\nThen run kingoappcom similar free software. Which will work. Just running the kingoapp windows software without first running renewandroid  will not work. Funny situation. Takes about 30 minutes and many automated reboots  it includes freezing for 6 minutes - just run both programs until they finish.\", 'Got it for EUR50  and for that price it\\'s a great bargain. 2 SIM slots (mini+micro) plus microSD  removable battery  4G and 5\" and Android 5.x.\\n \\r\\nSpeed is good  but not as great as a phone to 10-fold the price - expensive phones are rather disappointing in speed considering the price difference. Sound quality for calls is good  could be by chance - but often better than Samsung S6.\\n \\r\\nThe screen is very sensitive to light angle  ie. colors change - unlike AMOLED if you hold it slightly wrong. Camera is also not as great or quick as with high priced models  but this is perfectly acceptable for this price considering that the phone is otherwise as good as the most expensive phones.\\n \\r\\nWas skeptical to 4GB memory as that was too little for Samsung with android 4.x. But on this phone  space is not a problem - I\\'ve installed at least 30 apps and can use microSD for GPS maps  movies and other memory hungry items.\\n \\r\\nThere seems to be a GPS bug  i.e. not all GPS apps will install. However  Sygic and Google Maps work great.\\n \\r\\nOnly reason to consider a more costly phone is if you want the best camera quality when taking pictures or if you have so much money to spend that you might as well get a bit higher speed and more flexible viewing angles.\\n \\r\\nLanguage menu choices are limited to mostly EU languages and a few others for the phone I got.\\n \\r\\nSo far  the best deal I\\'ve got for a phone.

The screen is absolutely terrible  the viewing angles are ridiculous and I won't even mention the screen res  at  480*854  it speaks for itself. The battery won't give you more than 2h of sot. The 5mp shooter is shit so are the 3.5gb of storage.\\n \\r\\nThe bloatware is another joke from Yezz (even the name of that brand is repulsive). Once you start the phone  the first thing you do is actually uninstalling/disabling 100% of the non-Google apps. The gig of ram is just not enough  or rather  the ram management is weak.. I bought this phone as a temporary device  I didn't bought it to make it my daily driver  thank god.\\n \\r\\nFor some reasons  the 4g sim slot stopped getting signal so I returned it (bad customer service btw) and finally decided to buy a refurbished Amazon Fire Phone (same price than this shitty Andy)  which is an immensely better phone once you set up the Play Store and use a decent launcher.\\n \\r\\nYezz ? Would rather go for Nozz.\\n \\r\\n0.5/10\", 'it has no Aufofocus ... video capture is only HD and 15frames/sec ..poor camera like 10 years old phones ..... internal memory is only 4gb and user accesible is 3.5gb ....', 'hoW is that camra qualitY']",

You are free to argue all you want  but almost nobody has been referring to \"rip-off\" with regards to its specs. \\n \\r\\nLet\\'s consider the opposite case: if two phones have near-identical specs but their outside design looks completely different  then nobody is going to call it a rip-off. \\n \\r\\nYou can change the internals as much as you want  price it differently  but at the end of the day if it looks like an iPhone  then it\\'s going to get called an iPhone clone no matter what.

I even had an issue a few months ago  got ahold of them via email  after a few back and fourths they sent me a shipping label in an attachment  I sent the phone off to then  it was back in two weeks flat and fixed. I kid you not.', \"I bought my RM6 2 weeks ago. So far  I enjoy the phone a lot. It is a performance beast. This phone really will handle everything you throw at it. I bought it mainly because I love emulating older consoles on my phone  and it beats anything I've ever used at doing so. The phone stays at reasonably cool temperatures no matter what you are doing. The fan noise is jarring at first  but you eventually begin to not notice it as you would a laptop or PC fan. The drawbacks listed in the article exist  as well as a few I've found along the way. For example  I've found that when the screen is in 90hz mode the colours shift  it's slight  but noticeable especially if the phone is constantly auto switching. It is something that can be avoided however  if you're willing to tweak some settings. Some translations in the software are pretty bad  but I find them to be more entertaining than annoying. They are never to the point where they're incomprehensible  as long as you are using a bit of common sense to help with the translations. The RBG customization leaves a bit to be desired as well. On the brighter side of things  this phone is fast and I mean FAST. I am genuinely taken aback by the launch times of apps  load times of games  etc. I came from an iPhone XS before this phone and that always felt reasonably snappy but this? This blows it completely out of the water. The combined high refresh rate and high touch sample rate lead to a greater feeling of connection when interacting with the phone. It makes pages feel attached to your finger  and really brings the phone alive. I have yet to have a hiccup or random app crash with this phone  which is really impressive. Altogether  the RM6 is an amazing purchase  especially considering the price. It has its flaws  but it is also a chance to own a completely unique phone. It really is a conversation starter. If you are a serious mobile gamer  or someone who just wants to make a statement by being unique this phone is for you. \", 'Hi can anyone share the experience of buying from red magic global site?', 'Anyone using the global version of this phone?

Heck if I didn't own one and was thinking of buying one and I saw these reviews  I'd be terrified to purchase it. But as it is  I've owned this phone now for ...... (Let me go check my visible account to exact date ...... Got it!) Over 7 months. I got it in the beginning on May. We're in December now. And this phone has been used heavily  daily  and has been blowing me away! I had a nieces wedding in the Summer  my whole family told me how freaking good n sharp my pics looked. Which phone was it?? A ZTE  A what??! So I have no idea what these people here are talking about  sounds like they either got a defective product  which happens with any brand or product almost. Or they're making it up. But my selfie camera works perfectly  I tested now to make sure after reading these reviews  I switched back n forth from back to front cameras. No glitch! Switched perfectly! My screen works perfectly  all 100% of it! And I've fallen and dropped it and banged it  God knows how many times. So idk what these reviews are about. I'm going 7 months of perfect smooth fast phone. And the hardware in it should tell you just that. It's the best hardware avail in even phones priced double than this. The only thing it comes up a little short in maybe. Is that it doesn't really have full 5G like The Samsung n apples etc do. It only has one type of 5G band  where as those have 2 (nm  and something else. Idk exactly) but still  even only this one supposedly weaker 5g band that this does have is giving me speeds WAY faster than 4G. So I guess it's good enough for me. But everywhere else this has not fallen short of any other phones costing double this does. \\r\\nSo please don't believe these outages wild claims in these horrible reviews. It's A GREAT phone! \", 'Seems that I am having some of the same problems as far as some of the screen portions  more so the bottom 3rd  not working and the selfie camera not working at all(it goes to that screen but it freezes there  nothing  absolutely nothing on the screen works). \\r\\nYes the specs are pretty impressive on paper for the $360 I paid for but the more I use it the more it fails.

This one performed poorly at what would seem to be its primary function.\\n\", 'I bought this phone from Yahoo mobile and transitioned to Visible.

The 2nd time I reset the phone before sending it to them and they sent it back to me because they couldn\\'t find anything wrong with it.  Less than 2 weeks later it started freezing again.  If you reset the phone to factory settings with no apps installed it will work for awhile longer.  On the 3rd return they sent me a new phone. (refurbished) and it last all of a week before the new phone Selfie Camera froze on me.

It\\'s not worth the headache   I\\'m seeing more and more posts of other people suffering the same fate.', \"Bought this phone through Visible. It was their least expensive 5G phone yet still had impressive specs. The camera cache has to be cleared every time you switch from the rear camera to the front and back again to fix the crash  and it does forget the bottom 5th of the screen every now and again. I fix that by moving around icons then putting them back. It is going back for warranty repair as the proximity sensor crapped out. It is a nice phone when it works  but it isn't nearly as reliable as the Samsung phones I've had over the years. I've only had it for 3.5 months. Not the best reliability.\", 'Trash phone.

The Poco F2 Pro is 219g while the ZTE Axon 20 is 198g  that\\'s 21g  like c\\'mon  also the 20 isn\\'t heavier because it is stupid thin at 8mm. \\r\\nMany people complained about huge phones  and there is more people than you imagine who have issues holding a too thin phone. \\r\\nI made an experiment with my GF  she has hand heal issues and couldn\\'t hold something heavy for too long  yet she is perfectly fine holding a 313g M bot tab 71 tablet for hours.\\n \\r\\nI\\'ve already argued about possibly every imaginable issues  there are a lot of people like you finding imaginary arguments against the pop up  which at the end  all fall short from their difference with reality.\\n \\r\\nIt is actually super easy to repair  not only it self-retract (not entirely  but enough) in case of fall  but also most of the time using the calibration feature will fix it  also don\\'t blame a piece of tech if you can\\'t properly hold it  would you complain that a glass bottle break if you drop it ? \\r\\nNo  because you simply have to be careful  and even without particular efforts  I\\'ve almost never dropped my phone. \\r\\nIt cumulates with the fact that it have been proven though against SLAM TESTS  not just drop tests  but slam tests  it needs to fall on the pop up in order to damage it  AND it will only occur if the camera is opened  that\\'s a lot of \"if\" scenario here.\\n \\r\\nIt is actually fast enough  any video proved it is actually superfast when it is well done  and we aren\\'t even talking about the possibility to make it electromagnetic actuated which would be superfast and allow to reduce the internal space taken while also making it totally waterproof.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gU9fFcX1C0&feature=youtu.be&t=159 \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHtRYt-5bIk \\n \\r\\nActually it is THE BEST way to provide 3D facial recognition which CANNOT be accurately made under display  simply because while crappy  the pictures of the Axon 20 are actually gone through A LOT of software work  they are reconstructed as much as possible  the raw quality is probably laughable  even worse than 2Mp Macro camera  but while using AI for making an image appearing better is no problem for picture use  it doesn\\'t work for biometric which need real RAW data  and not altered data. \\r\\nAnd apart from the Oppo Find X which prove motorized camera can work with facial recognition  there is also some slider phones that confirm that. \\r\\nBut tell me  what do you prefer  an underdisplay camera that give you awful selfies and if it were to have 3D face recognition would reconstruct your face based on what an AI have learned to do  therefor reconstructing all faces similarly causing the phone to potentially identify anything as you  having an iPhone notch  having a bezel  or having an uninterrupted display? \\r\\nMy fictional concept phone would smoke every other in terms of both 3D face recognition reliability and face unlocking speed despite having a pop up :\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/ykYfaa6 \\n \\r\\nThat\\'s funny you say that  just today I saw an article reading that a security company employee have admited watching 200 people having sex at home.\\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9174365/ADT-technician-admits-hacking-home-security-cameras-spy-naked-women-couples-having-sex.html \\n \\r\\nYou people constantly underestimate the dangers and issues of lack of privacy. \\r\\nAnd while I wish no one will be victim to that  I can\\'t wait for the first reveal of extremely unethical use of smartphone front camera by X or Y app that will be leaked and give everyone a big kick to let them realize privacy is actually nice. \\r\\nHow in the name of weirdness anyone can advocate AGAINST privacy? \\r\\nHow do you know what companies exploited  there are people that laugh at me when I say leaked user\\'s passwords are available for sale on the deep web despite being a reality  but it isn\\'t about that  you can literally buy someone\\'s identity  and trust me having an identity thief is the last thing over internet you ever want  anything else is details compared to that. \\r\\nPlus  your claims are literally out of date and totally false  it isn\\'t because you aren\\'t concerned (yet) that it doesn\\'t happen :\\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/chinas-huawei-tested-ai-software-that-could-identify-uighurs-report.html ', 'FlarosOverfield  24 Jan 2021>K30 pro has under display camera\\r\\n?????????I meant Underdisplay Fingerprint Scanner... \\r\\nBut  well  if you think about it  it is an underdisplay camera too  and while the pop up is retracted  it is under the display  so...', 'Demongornot  21 Jan 2021I love how you pull arguments out of nowhere.\\r\\nHow do you know the failure rate of underdispla... moreCan you first explain to me how an under screen camera is supposed to break?

      "review": "[\"The battery don't last for long\", 'Purchased this phone back in May 2019  as it is an older model  carrier gives it out for free. I must mention my previous phone was a Moto G5 Plus  and it was really hard to retire it  but believe it or not  it was getting slower. So I liked the slim look of the V9  and I while I don\\'t like fingerprint sensors on the back  I also liked the dual camera. Well  the fingerprint sensor is the main thing I ended up having troubles with. While the Motorola was quick and easy to use  barely touching it  the V9 requires that I slowly approach my finger tip and make it lay almost entirely flat or it won\\'t read it. That sucks. I\\'ve actually thought about disabling that option because of it. Another thing is the antenna is either too weak or simply bad  while my previous phone would get incoming calls everywhere in my apartment  this one I have to place in a specific spot by the window to keep the signal. It has restarted on its own a couple of times. And the worst feature that annoys me the most  when downloading an app  even though it\\'s set up to download on any network and is on wi-fi  it \"queues\" it  so I have to wait for an undetermined period of time for it to actually install the app I want. Same thing with the updates. Yes  it\\'s not an expensive phone  but I\\'m already planning on selling it and pay the difference to get a Moto G7 Plus. ', 'I like it ‚ô•', \"I don't have too many problems with the phone seeing as it only left me short ¬£130  maybe the odd miss-click every now and then when it gets too hot; my big issue is the sound. I can't hear a word of what people are saying when I'm in a call outside. I hoped using earphones would help  but the volume on them is just as low for whatever reason. I checked if there was any way to increase the volume  but apparently this is the best it can do. So now I'm stuck carrying around two phones because this one cant do its job.\", \"Anonymous  12 May 2018how can you buy & review it when it's not available yet? i can't find it in china or any c... morehttps://m.banggood.com/ZTE-Blade-V9-5_7-inch-Full-Screen-3GB-RAM-32GB-ROM-Snapdragon-450-Octa-core-4G-Smartphone-p-1266454.html?rmmds=search#popupStatedetail \", \"Alex  04 May 2018Using it heavily for 2 weeks now.

Performance is decent  never gets hot  battery level doesn't... moreHow much did you bought it? Thanks :)\", \"Using it heavily for 2 weeks now. Performance is decent  never gets hot  battery level doesn't drop like crazy. Camera is surprisingly good. Screen is OK - very bright and visible in direct sunlight  good enough colors and viewing angles  much better than the ultra budget phones  but far far away from what flagships have to offer. Battery life is excellent. Been watching movies (saved on MicroSD card) for 6 hours on one battery charge. 48h of mostly standby left it with 50% battery  and that's WITH apps installed like WhatsApp  Facebook  Facebook Messenger  Skype  Gmail  BlueMail  Viber  Google Assistant  etc. Which is probably because they're not running and not giving me notifications (bad).\\n \\r\\nMy biggest issues so far: \\r\\n1. Almost non-existent customer base. Hard to find any accessories  xda-developers thread on this phone is completely dead  with no hopes on getting a custom ROM. \\r\\n2. Zero support on the phone. You can't even find the official product page from ZTE. System updates are completely dead  giving me an error that there is no network connection (probably the update server is offline). It's good now because it's one of the first 3rd party phones with Android 8.1 out of the box  but it will probably be garbage within a year. \\r\\n3. Existing software is kinda bad. With 3GB of RAM  most apps restart completely after  just several seconds of switching to another app  even though there are 500MB free. And why is there only 500MB free?! The OS is seriously bloated. Best thing anyone would do to this phone is install LineageOS 15 on it  which will probably never happen. \\r\\n4. Both speakers are very weak. A phone conversation is next to impossible near a busy street. Max volume is just enough for one person to understand what they're saying in a video. \\r\\n5. Fingerprint sensor reacts to the skin on my leg while I keep it in my pants pocket (tried many pairs of pants). Result - fingerprint is locked due to too many failed attempts  and when I'm wearing my bluetooth headset which is a trusted device  the phone simply unlocks and stays turned ON inside the pocket whenever it touches my leg with the fingerprint reader. Thus I have to put it with the screen facing the leg  which on a hot summer day might mean that I take it out with the screen full of drops of sweat.\", 'Nadalion  25 Feb 2018 Seriously  $300 for sd450?

I achieved over two days with moderate use. UI is not bad. Because of some reason (maybe because of my wifi and opereator and not the phone) internet pages and youtube load somewhat slower. Otherwise it opens applications quite quickly. It has sensitive screen so make sure to buy screen protection a.s.a.p. (until then avoid to put it with sharp items e.g. car keys.) Poor plastic built quality - you can hear creaking sounds sometimes when you hold it. Good to buy silicon case because plastic is slippery. Don`t expect miracles with camera for this price range but I use it anyway for takeing notes and some other things where it is not so important (no people and selfies). Anyway until now I didn`t test or paid attention on camera so much but maybe after some time I come back and give my opinion on that. Camera interface is not stupid and strange. If you dont want to spend a lot of money on phone and duration of battery is important to you I can definitely recommend this smartphone.', 'Anonymous  29 Jul 2018Honestly its Looks like a iPhone 6lol exactly same with the Xiaomi Redmi 4 (4X) also', 'I had problems with this phone.

Additionally  calls are frequently dropped due to a weak signal. Now  I know that this is a common problem with most phones  however  I did not have this problem with my previous Moto E phone. The signal was always strong  calls were clear and rarely dropped. The other feature is the speaker - it sucks! When I put a caller on speaker  I can barely hear them without holding the phone up to my ear -  which defeats the purpose of putting them on speaker in the first place.

Are you kidding me', \"This is by far hands down the best phone I have ever owned. I bought mine new in August 2017 and have not just used it everyday since but over used it is putting it lightly. I've been out of work since December of that same year and ever since then I've spent a minimum of 16 hours and as much as 20 hours a day playing 3 multiplayer phone games  streaming movies  shopping  reading and web browsing. I often fall asleep while charging the phone and it falls between myself and the chair I sit in and the battery has overheated countless times. So much so that the phone itself I has a bulge now in the back where the heat either swelled the battery or just warped the case or both! The point is when you overheat a battery regardless of how but especially while charging it is the worst thing you can do to that battery. Nothing kills it quicker than heat. Yet this phone going on 4 years still charges and lasts very close to the same time as it did the day I bought it! Obviously it's lessened some but it'll still web browse for about 5-6 hours stream a full 2hr movie  play games for 2 or 3 hours or more depending on t forhe game. For instance Star Trek timelines goes about 4 hours or more on a full charge  but Marvel Strike Force the battery only lasts 2 or 3 hours at most.  The phone can stay on standby for about 2 or 3 days with WiFi on in background and with it in airplane mode it's lasted 3 to 4 days. Basically this phone shoul betrayedd be dead with how many times I've overheated it. The battery is non interchangeable of course. The other features that really impressed me were the storage was great! The internal storage held most of my games and pictures which is a lot. For extra long with onlyvideos I added a 8 gig storage card and I've never had a storage problem. The speed of the phone was great with the snapdragon quad processor. It could use more internal RAM with only 2gb it's sufficient until you have too many background apps running you'll start to have lagging and screen lock which will drive you mad! Other than that minor issue I cannot say enough great things about this phone so if you ever see one still out there grab it!!\", \"Please I need help a puy.

Just to be clear... moreI disagree with the statement that the phone has no software issues. I bought this phone in January of 2020  from the very start i noticed slow speeds  extremely limited ram  and unable to keep apps open between uses. Out of the box  everytime i would would open an app  leave  and come back to it  the app would reset and be back at the starting page. Webpages/ app never failed to unload. This phone has been very slow  even compared to the lg cheapo ($40) phone. It has frame rate issues  and a few unique problems with certain apps already preloaded onto the phone. Its held up just fine in an industrial environment. It looks and operates the exact same as the day i got it  so its very rugged and reliable with an amazing battery. I wouldn't buy again specifically because of the frustrating failures and setbacks of the software\", \"Please update the phone's network from 2G to 4G  \\r\\nBecause it is toooooo slow. \\r\\nPlease do something about it \\r\\nPlease we beg you  do something about it  \", 'Joe  03 Aug 2020The Blade ZTE Max is the best smart phone I have ever owned  and used so far. Just to be clear... morePlease update the phone from 2 to 4g. The 2g phone is too slow', 'The Blade ZTE Max is the best smart phone I have ever owned  and used so far. Just to be clear  I know how to care for  and maintain a cell phone. Yes. That is a thing. I see some comments talking about how the phone is horrible  garbage  etc... simply put. They don\\'t take care of their smart phones. Smart phones are mini computers that require care. This includes updating the software  avoiding ad based Apps  keeping the phone memory clear of clutter/ up to par  etc... But enough about what should be basic... let\\'s talk about the phone. I must have accidentally grazed and bashed on the screen dozens of times  and not one crack has appeared. The Asahi Dragontrail is surprisingly super strong (in my experience). The battery eventually got weaker (like all smart phone batteries) after a year or so  so I purchased a replacement on eBay and watched a youtube video on how to remove the \"non-removable battery\". I was successful in emulating that procedure  and so I added more ample time per charge once more. I never had a problem with the phone as far as speed  slow/sluggish issues go. Then again  as I stated... I know how to take good care of my cell phones. I love the 6 inch screen and watch all my shows on my phone. I love the split screen option (this is an Android Software feature) on my screen which works wonders when I\\'m watching a show or movie while scrolling on facebook. The time draws very near where I am going to have to buy a new phone. Sadly  the Blade ZTE Max can\\'t process 5G  so that would be the chief reason I would have to part with it. Overall  the Blade ZTE Max is a hell of a phone if you take proper care of it. ', \"Someguy  27 May 2020It's been a great phone for the past two years but now the phone is three years old.

The truth is yes you can do better for double the price. But I'm into saving money anyway I can. This phone does everything I need it to do with no problems. In fact I love this phone because it was only $30 plus $5 for a 16mb SD card.\", \"I agree with these reviews.  I HATE this phone.  it tries to run you not the other way around.  You just can't get enough space available to satisfy this phone. I am getting rid of it as soon as I can free up some of my SS monies.   Next month hopefully.  what a waste of my limited income this phone was!  \", \"This phone has been a headache an a half the one thing I have is patience and it's in incredibly dangerously no running thin.theres no storage space I don't have a single app and I've disabled  force stopped  and uninstalled every possible update and still it says running out of storage space.  This phone is a waste of money time  and energy DO NOT RECOMMEND\", \"This is the absolute worse phone ever!!! It fills up the 8GB internal memory immediately with god knows what. Constantly complaining that it is out of space asking what to uninstall when there is nothing installed!! It is the slowest phone ever and doesn't even let me know when a message comes because it is out of space so some system functions don't work. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!! Don't even take it if someone tries to give you one for free!! \", \"This phone is terrible......VERY slow in every aspect....constantly updating......even lagged when trying to type a text or check emails. Do not buy this phone.....also contantly having to delete things cause storage space was full. Two weeks was enough for me then I had to get something else. Don't waste your time or money!!!!\", \"Worst phone I have ever had. Garbage.  8 GB fills up in 2 weeks with updates. Slow and aggravating to use.

The big screens is comfortable for watching netflix or youtube and the processor is pretty good so games run smooth and overall a big good cheap phone.', \"I've had my Max Xl since they came out in '17. Absolutely NO problems with it! Great phone.\\n\", 'Loved this phone when I got it  but it\\'s been downhill ever since. Problems: \\r\\n--despite messing repeatedly w/ security settings (enabling on-body sensor  establishing \"safe\" locations (home  work)  and extending active time before sleep)  it still seems to require entering the password virtually EVERY time that I use it. \\r\\n--I had been accidentally activating the camera taking it out of its holster  so I disabled the one-touch camera option and moved the app off the home screen -- but the camera STILL turns itself on when it feels like it  which is often. \\r\\n--touch fingerprint sensor used to be good  but now doesn\\'t work 99.9 percent of the time (have tried various fixes  cleaning sensor w/ alcohol  etc. -- no luck.) \\r\\n--set up face recognition to unlock phone  but that has NEVER worked (maybe I\\'m too ugly). \\r\\n--camera doesn\\'t work sometimes -- I take a bunch of photos and then discovered that none of them were taken. The \"shutter\" sound is almost inaudible. Also  it\\'s supposed to be an automatic flash  but that rarely works -- I\\'ve got a lot of photos that appear to have been taken at the bottom of a coal mine. \\r\\n--have had repeated problems w/ syncing to my gmail account  calendar  contacts  etc. For example  it still doesn\\'t store my recent or favorite phone numbers  except every once in a while. \\r\\n--one HUGE problem: sometimes voicemail messages (either the notification or the actual messages) don\\'t appear until 2-3 days after receiving them. \\r\\n--you\\'re supposed to be able to unlock the phone by saying \"OK Google\" or \"Hey  Google\" (can\\'t remember which). Doesn\\'t work. However  either of them will activate Google voice search  which I don\\'t want. \\r\\n--traffic navigation function is awful. tried to use a couple of times and wound up w/ nonsensical directions. \\r\\n--in an attempt to solve these problems  I\\'ve gone to a clean factory re-install at least twice  which solved a couple  but not most of them. \\r\\n--there are no custom holster/belt loop cases available. The largest generic holster that I could find isn\\'t thick enough to hold the phone if it\\'s already got a typical (thin) case on it  making it almost impossible to get out of the holster. \\r\\n--the phone installs tons of apps that I don\\'t want  don\\'t need  or never heard of. \\r\\n--the adaptive lighting option makes the screen too dim inside a car -- I\\'ve disabled for a fixed brightness. \\r\\n--when installing new apps  it scatters them over a couple of different screens  instead of filling them up one at a time. \\r\\n--there has been at least one Android update from Boost  but it didn\\'t improve anything. \\r\\n--Boost\\'s documentation is also crap -- am using AT&T documentation instead. \\r\\n--when making or answering a call  screen goes black within seconds  and have to push the side button to get it back  usually after a 1-2 second delay. \\r\\n--phone sometimes doesn\\'t want to end a call \\r\\n--during a call  or at random other times  phone will lock up and require rebooting \\r\\n--occasionally  the phone likes to  spontaneously turn the phone ringer to vibrate or off. I\\'ve learned to check the volume level a couple of times a day. \\r\\n--2 gb RAM is barely adequate. I\\'m usually at the 99 percent level  even though I try to weed out unwanted apps. \\r\\nA couple of pluses:  \\r\\n--it was really cheap w/ a new Boost account \\r\\n--huge screen is nice \\r\\n--being able to add a micro SD card for storage is good  but you have to figure out how to set it as the storage default. \\r\\n--I\\'ve dropped it on the floor a couple of times  without a case  and it hasn\\'t broken \\r\\n--super-long battery life and very quick charging \\r\\n--it\\'s not an overpriced  \"nanny\" iPhone  which I hated when I had one. \\r\\n--I can pawn it off on my wife  and she can use it for games.\\n \\r\\nI\\'ve had this phone long enough that I\\'m going to try a different phone -- not ZTE. (Allegedly  ZTE is also on the US government blacklist along with Huawei for supplying network technology because it\\'s too close to the Chinese Commies. I say that if the Commies are using phones like this there\\'s not much to worry about.)', 'I got rid of it for a LG styling 5 \\r\\nlittle better lol', 'Would not recommend the ZTE Max XL phone. Though it has a larger screen  thats where it ends. Issues as stated camera almost impossible to take great photos. Random restarts. Battery life quirky and if you are able to figure out what is causing the drain  it will hold the battery a little longer. \\n \\r\\nOne of my phones is stuck booting on logo screen.  So in essence I am going to lose all my data once I do a factory restore which may or may not fix the booting problem. RIDICULOUS!!!   \\n \\r\\nMy 2nd Max XL has started running so slow. Random updates are sent to phone kinda constantly which may be the culprit of the mfr actually making the phone slower so you go buy a new one.  Henceforth it would not be this same miserable phone or a newer version of the miserable phone that may last 2 years at best. \\n \\r\\nIf anyone has ideas on how I can get my data off a phone that is stuck on the boost Mobile boot screen  please let me know.', \"Well.

I was so used to not having room for my Apps  or having to move things to a memory card  but this was never this issue on this phone. It took me AGES to fill it up  and even then  I had so much room that having to delete an app to install a new one was simple  bc there were several apps I'd forgotten I installed  and hadn't used in ages.  \\r\\nThe camera was amazing  I dropped it with no case multiple times and it never broke or even cracked  it was just fantastic.  \\r\\nThere are two downsides I have to mention though. I have kids  and my kids are messy. One of the first things to happen was that the sound went out on one of the two bottom speakers  but I'm pretty sure it's because one of my kids got water in it  and it was still loud enough not to be an issue for a long time.  \\r\\nIssue number two is mainly an issue because it led to the ultimate downfall of the phone. You cannot remove the battery. You have to hold the button down to turn it off  and if it gets wet you can't just take the battery out to keep it from turning off and on. However  with that being said  let me tell you about what happened.  \\r\\nThe 1st time this phone got wet  I was listening to music in the bathtub (stupid I know). I was using headphones bc I was just soaking sore muscles  and I hated the way the sound echoed in our bathroom. Eventually I messed up and turned my head (headphones had a short cord) and pulled the entire phone into the tub. I got it out right away and towel dried it as quick as possible  but I couldn't take the battery out  so all I could do was wait for the battery to drain. It did eventually  and I left it off for 3 days  praying it still worked. Amazingly it did turn on and I had no further issues.  \\r\\nThe 2nd time it got wet  one of the much younger kids spilled a drink on my side table. Same thing  it kept turning on and off and even holding the button down for an extended time wouldn't make it stop turning off and on  so again I dried it as much as possible  and once it died completely  I left it off for a few days. Turned it back on and it worked  with no issues.  \\r\\nThe THIRD time (you'd think we'd have learned by no  lol but no)  my then 11 year old was using it while she was in the bathroom. She had it sitting on her leg  and turned to grab toilet paper  and it slid off her leg and into the toilet. We dried it off  and again waited until it turned off  but I knew this time was different right away because the screen stopped coming on after a few minutes of turning off and on  and once it died  I left it off for several days  but it did no good. I charged it and tried to turn it back on  and nothing happened to the screen  but the sound still worked. Then the alarm started going off and I had no way to turn it off beyond holding the button down to shut it down completely. The alarm was set to go off even if the phone was off  so it continued going off until the battery eventually drained  and that was the end of an otherwise fantastic phone.  \\r\\nGotta run or I'd add more  but overall it's a great phone. It's too bad I'm awful with keeping it from getting wet. \", '::Anonymous::  18 Sep 2018So is the phone compatible with AT&T?Yes it will.

I bought this phone instead of getting a tablet.. I wanted a budget Android tablet but they were all awfully slow and had very small storage capacities.. The screen is big enough to enjoy watching videos on and also reading ebooks. The phone also has a headphone jack and what also surprised me was the inclusion of the Dolby digital plus software which greatly enhances the sound and it's very noticeable... the soundcard on the phone kinda sucks but the Dolby sound enhancement software makes up for it.\\n \\r\\nWhen I first saw this phone  I was very impressed by the quality of the screen and the microphone was really good.. for a budget midrange phone  the hardware specs blew away other budget phones at the time.. this phone had a USB C port which was unheard of at the time for a budget phone.. and the hardware was really impressive  32GB storage which was more generous than other budget flagships at the time which only had 16GB. The processor is not too bad  it's a Snapdragon 617 which is better than the cheap MediaTek CPUs other phones had.. the phone can be fast sometimes but it also can be slow sometimes. One of my biggest issues was the small RAM size.. it's only 2GB of RAM and if you have too much apps in the background  it'll shut down apps you have running in the background.\\n \\r\\nThe phone originally was $179.99 full price but only $100 if you sign up with an account.. the price is actually unbelievable for the hardware specs you're getting.. the phone served me very well as an entertainment device and it's better than getting an in iPad mini which has very low end specs. \\n \\r\\nThey actually updated this phone  it was called the Blade Z Max.. I tested that phone and it was a DOWNGRADE from the Zmax Pro.. they downgraded the screen because it looks more washed out and the microphone sounded horrible. The battery was bigger but that's about it.\\n \\r\\nThe 3200 mAh battery on this phone started to become weak.. I just paid for a 3800 mAh battery and the battery life is much better.\", \"Anonymous  26 Mar 2020I was ripped of by Metro Pcs......they new about the legal problems with ZTE.

Now  3.5 years LATER. the battery has issues just like everyone else says. but that\\'s NOT my complaint. i already stated my issue.  having a battery die after YEARS of non stop service is expectable. And yes  there is no EASY removable back to replace the battery in a easy fashion. but  is that still a thing ANYWAYS ?   it\\'s fashioned that way so you DONT remove the back easily becuase components are WIRED to it and if you just willy illy yank it you\\'d mess your phone up considerably.

I had to use WD40 to loosen the glue  and a flathead to pry the friggin thing out of the phone LOL I know not all ZMAX PRO's have their batteries glued in like that  but if yours does  it's a problem. Also  there's a lot of screws to loosen  and it's VERY easy to crack the outer shell while prying off the back cover. Also easy to accidentally disconnect things like the fingerprint scanner  flash  etc. Of course they're easy to reconnect but you might have to take the phone apart to do so which isn't fun. \\n \\r\\nYou gotta keep in mind that not everyone is comfortable taking electronics apart.

Very poor quality touch screen.loll im promoting zte blade a110', 'The ZTE Blade A110 is a budget end phone  it has decent specs for the budget end of the small size smartphone market considering what is now available (pixi first/huawei y3 etc).  Of the 8GB internal memory just over half (around 4GB) was available to use.  \\n \\r\\nI contacted ZTE New Zealand via Facebook messenger (they were very prompt to reply) they said it probably wasn\\'t worth unlocking the phone it was network locked to (to travel/insert another SIM card) because of the limited bands it worked on.  Specifically my phone only works on: 4G bands/frequencies B3(1800)/B7(2600)/B28(700) and 3G frequencies 850/2100.  My network doesn\\'t support 2G but it seems the phone also has some 2G capabilities based on info displayed from an app I have installed on my phone.  So these 3G and 4G frequencies are different to and more limited bands than GSM Arena has listed as the phone being compatible with.  So please check your version of this phone and your network before buying - don\\'t rely on getting ALL of the bands GSM Arena has said you\\'d get with this phone.  (This is unfortunate  as I rely on this site for doing comparisons all the time... but thought I\\'d update the info given I have it.)\\n \\r\\nFull specs for the NZ Spark Lite and Skinny Swift versions and the Australia Optus Zip and Coles Shout of this phone (all specs are identical): \\r\\n- http://www.ztemobiles.com.au/A110_Skinny.htm  \\r\\n- http://www.ztemobiles.com.au/A110_Spark.htm  \\r\\n- http://www.ztemobiles.com.au/A110_Optus.htm  \\r\\n- http://www.ztemobiles.com.au/A110_Coles.htm \\n \\r\\nIt\\'s essentially about the same size as the Samsung S4 mini - which I loved  and it died... so this is the replacement - it is not as good as the S4 mini in many ways  but it does seem to have a much better wifi receptor (I couldn\\'t get wifi on my s4 mini in one part of the house and I can get a tiny amount of wifi on this).\\n \\r\\nBe aware that I have recently seen a \"newer\" version of the phone released WITHOUT 4G capability for $10 cheaper here in NZ.  Make sure you know which version you\\'re getting :)  (possibly this is the L110 version  but I don\\'t know)\\n \\r\\nA big negative is the phone battery drains very quickly with use  and it takes at least 4 hours to charge.  It also has Android 5 installed and you can\\'t upgrade this.  This is annoying as I was on Android 4.4 Kitkat where I could put some apps onto the micro SD card  but it turns out Android 5 Lollipop you can\\'t!  So this means you are more limited in terms of space on the internal storage for apps.  I\\'ve only been using it for around a fortnight or so and already out of space.  I\\'ve just added a micro SD card - max it will take is 32GB - and will see if I can figure out a way around this  but not holding my breath!   Apparently in Android 6.0 Marshmallow you can shift things again  but I don\\'t know.  I don\\'t really like the interface with Android 5 - the pull down menu from the top is more fiddly than 4.4 Kitkat and not as user-friendly.  \\n \\r\\nThe screen is decent enough  sometimes I find it easy enough to type with the onscreen keyboard  other times I\\'m pushing the wrong \"key\" - it\\'s a bit fiddly because the screen is smaller.  But I want a phone that fits into my (girl) pocket.  It\\'s good enough.  It\\'s a little worse than the Samsung s4 mini which is probably because the pixels per inch is slightly reduced a little here (256 to 233ppi).\\n \\r\\nGood point: It has a radio :) ... lots of new phones seem to be missing this!  I don\\'t understand leaving a radio out... you can\\'t be connected to the net all the time and I don\\'t want to pay for data all the time either... free music with local content all the way! :)\\n \\r\\nAnnoying: to take a screenshot (volume down and power button) it makes a really LOUD noise  and it makes the same LOUD noise to take photos.  I can\\'t find a way to stop this.  Occassionally with the screenshot it seems to not make the noise and I have no idea why but I wish it was all the time! I have tried turning phone on silent - doesn\\'t work.\\n \\r\\nGood: There is an option to set the phone to turn off and wake up - so you can have it off overnight and then wake up in the morning.  I haven\\'t tried it yet  but considering the battery this is a good feature.  The alarm seems to go even if you turned the phone off (yay!)  so again  a good battery saving feature.  \\n \\r\\nIt\\'s only a 1Ghz processor but so far aside from reloading browser pages I haven\\'t noticed any problems.  It is annoying that browser pages don\\'t stay loaded - they refresh every time you go to a page.  If you can\\'t get wifi in an area this is annoying.  And it drains data unnecessarily.\\n \\r\\nOverall a good budget phone that fits into my pocket and can be used with one hand.  Wish it had 16GB internal and a faster processor and a better Android version and a better camera (only 5MP main) but it is good enough.  Glad I purchased. :)\\n', 'Completely useless. \\r\\nThe storage space is filled with 1058MB for the system  and even deleting most of the other apps still leaves me with a warning there is not enough space on the phone', 'Own one.

I am looking for a new one for ages now as they are now an older model it is impossible to buy online !\\n \\r\\nThe reason is I lost my phone two weeks ago and it was the best phone in terms of Reliability  as I dropped it over 20 times without a problem !! its built like a tank and has a massive battery\\n \\r\\nThanks!\", \"This phone was OK. \\r\\nI mean it was 139Eur when i got it  so cant complain. \\n \\r\\nDisplay/glass: \\r\\nSo first impresions were good  though was a little bummed with the glass. It doesnt have that coating thing and the glass feels cheap. You know when you pull your finger across a phone with gorilla glass and that coating  and it feels smooth. This feels the opposite. The glass is strong tho  really strong. \\r\\nThe screen is weird  when in cold the screens pixels die  legit  just die. And come back to life after a week or two. So in winter it was quite horiffic. Now the display is super super BRIGHT. I mean  seriously  its brighter than some samsungs flagships  I compared my screen brightnes to my friends nexus 5x and the nexus 5x was as bright  as the A452  on 40%. Amazing. The colors are nice too but i dont really know a lot about displays. So yeah. That was my two cents.\\n \\r\\nPerfomance: \\r\\nWell  its slow. Interface  home screen  normal apps like call and message are fine. But on facebook  youtube  its slow. And in games its bad  also dont try to watch youtube or browse 9gag and use messanger. It is so laggy. Also it gets filled up quickly  cuz 4 8GB is the phone itself  2GB of apps and it doesnt let you use the final GB's. That is strange. But on home screen its snappy. \\r\\nInterface: \\r\\nIt was hard  without a app drawer  and little customization  but i got used to it. And now i like it a lot.  \\r\\nBattery: \\r\\nAmazing! AMAZING for me. It gave me 8+ hours straight watching videos  atleast 10hours browsing the web. Now here is the only problem  when on heavy load  on the SoC  it loses quite alot of power. As fast a HTC M8. Maybe this display is so god damn bright  but im not sure.  \\r\\nCamera: \\r\\n50/50  have some fotos  looking absolutely amazing. And some looking horrible. In good lighting this camera is good  but in darker its so shit that i cant even explain how bad it is. \\n \\r\\nBuild: \\r\\nIts plastic  cheap  yes  but no random cracking  squeaking  and it seems to be sturdy.\\n \\r\\nOverall: \\r\\nCons: Perfomance  Glass in my opinion  camera in the dark. \\r\\nMediocre: Build  Glass strength  Android 5.1 \\r\\nPros: Battery  brightness of the display  Camera on day light  price? \", \"It's a good phone with an impressive battery.

Audio quality is excelente besides it includes in package a 50 dollar value headset from JBL that sounds very powerfull with the Dolby audio of the Axon. Wifi is awesome.. great speed... downloads are realy very fast. The design gives a phone with personality ... you wont get confused with this cell when you see it out there you\\'ll say Oh look it\\'s an Axon Phone.. jajaja And the display is the best Superb quality for an IPS panel the blacks are actually very good the resolution is awesome the details are exquisit... and it offers 3 color profiles there\\'s one called \"Polo\" that exceeds your expectations on color for this type of screens.

Other negative stuff is that tehy missed out an SD Card slot ... tough it have 32 Gb ROM that gives 25 Gb aprox for the user... but don\\'t limit my possibilities please ! And a better GPU could be used in this model according to the date it was manufactured... Generaly is an \"hybrid\" between mid-range phones and high-range phones... like AnTuTu says is a mid-high device That surely will satisfy your needs Like we sayd an excelnet phone but if you want top performance get the Axon Elite...  hope ZTE reads my post and offers to change my Axon for the Axon Elite jajajajaja..

It's my wife's old phone I rebuilt  it's motherboard fried. Love it so much I made a clone of it Incase it fails. I have hopped up these sooooo much. Best hop up is get a 64 gig card  put a memory card partitioning tool app on your computer. Wipe and partition the 64 gig card for 2 32 gig partitions because it will only accept a 32 gig card. It fakes out the cpu into believing it's a 32 gig and sneeks it in the back door. Once into the phone  just format for internal storage and it dumps all card info into cpu and the cpu accepts the 64 gig and agrees to it. The 60+ gig then appears into memory storage. Plus I dumped and disabled all junk factory apps  and added in software that lets me app storage in sd. My little 15 gig phone has over 2000 songs  50+ videos  2000+ pictures  20-30+ apps and so on. It still has 48 gigs of storage left!. Also a z957 parts interchange with the z958 so all but motherboard interchanges.

Purchased brand new about 7 months ago. Phone started powering off by itself(even with it being charged). After a few hours it would turn on by itself . Until one day it just didnt turn back on at all. So I returned it under warranty( 2 weeks without my phone). ZTE rep advised that they had sent out a new one since they had been unable to repair. Received the NEW ZTE MAX phone and had a 50% charge upon arrival  so I connected it to charger. I checked on it a few hours later and charge had gone down to 29%   left it overnight and in the am it was still @ 29% charge. I  called ZTE and they advised me to ship it back. At this point I was already upset but I shipped it back under the warranty. I will finally receive the phone back BUT now ZTE is telling me that they sent the broken phone back to me because it had WATER DAMAGE and is not covered under warranty. Phone never even came near water in the 1 day I had it out of the package charging you MORONS. I truly believe that they never sent a new one at all. What they sent was the same phone that had the SAME issue to begin with. ZTE has lost a customer today. ', 'how much user memory', 'No SD card  no removable battery. 16gb only. No sale.']",

And the best part unlike their weirdly heavy Nubia Z9 (seriously I still can't understand how a 5.2 inch device weigh 192 g) this phone is indeed easy to hold  the curved back provides nice grip. \\r\\nGreat job ZTE.\", 'Great phone  use it for work everyday  do email  photos  downloads  print from it  works great no lag. Good voice/sound quality  beautiful display  no problem with heat playing Real Racer 3  for example. No SD slot is bummer  but for me good. Ive had lesser quality cheap ZTE phones in the past-they never gave me any problems. I basically got it for less than $200 from Amazon Warehouse (open box  but pristine condition)  so worth it.']",

I think there is not enough memory for hardcore games (such as Critical Ops)  but its amazing for daily use. I also wish it was a bit larger  and it can be slow and the capacitive-touch buttons can be ultra-sensitive at times. Also  you cant lock your phone for about five minutes after your phone powers on. It also feels a bit cheap in the hand. Pretty decent phone though. I use it to watch all of my favorite DANK MEMES(TM)!', 'great cellphone', \" Cricket made me up-grade to a 4G phone  Sold me a ZTE Sonata 2. Very cheep phone.

As stated in other comments the internal memory is horrendous  with the 8gb quoted is more like 2.5gb free for basic apps like snapchat and Instagram. A MicroSD card is vital for any use of other apps or files. Downloading files to sdcard directly is available for some apps like vidmate and snaptube and is really the only option on this phone. Otherwise the calls and messages work fine and the touchscreen is great. The resolution is not high quality but still looks ok.

This phone is way under subpar. I thought $30 what a great price. It's overpriced by about $29. And you should give cash back on the dollar. The frustrations I've had with this phone over and over I got a 10 GB memory card just so that it could cover the updates of things I don't want. AT&T and the other companies  should not force down your throat apps you have no interest in. You should have the choice of loading Amazon their music player their radio station. Not say this is what you get. Say to you what would you like would you like Amazon here it's right here just download it. Out of a 5-star rating I would give this minus five stars.

The box  the phone and even the headset looks very premium. The box is the most premium box I have seen so far. Headset gives good quality and really loud sound. However the 810 SoC creates too much heat. The phone gets laggy after a month of use. Battery is not great. The heavy Nubia skin sucks. Notification issues over apps that use internet. I mean I don't get motifications for WhatsApp or such apps until I open that app. It says it supports fast charging but the charger inside the box doesn't. Below average camera.

The picture quality of the phone sucks if you try to have the case on  almost like there's a film over it. Even if you take the cover off  it's still pretty bad. The battery life is pretty decent I will admit  but certain chargers like car chargers can make the phone overheat very quickly and then shut down constantly. If it's summer  or hot... don't even think about using your phone if you're not in AC  overheats so fast. I don't like the Glass backing  because it'll restart out of no where  and then just get stuck on the restart screen  so you can't take the battery out to try and let it cool down. It was a good phone to get me through  but now I'm looking for a different one  because this one causes nothing but trouble. Especially with certain apps. It doesn't like loading pictures  and sometimes shuts down if I'm trying to send anything MMS. If you're looking for a cheap phone for a few months  then sure  choose this one. But if you can wait a few months and just get another phone later on  then I'd rather wait.\", 'I have had different phones for the past 25 years and this is hands down the best phone I have ever had  especially for the price. I never heard of A ZTE before  the sales person introduced me to it and I will definitely continue to buy their product in the future.', \"I am a phone technician. 1st Im tired of reading people compare this to the S4...the S4 is two years older than this. That is an unfair comparison. So This phone  the camera is horrible the low light photos look like a bowl of grits. The battery life is good. The screen is horrible very low pixel density. Over all this phone blows  but for the price you get a big screen  and decent speed  That's it. \", \"I bought this phone to replace a much more expensive Samsung with a cracked screen. I have had this phone for around 6 months and I like it a lot. It is reliable and the big screen is great for reading  watching movies  etc. A couple of downsides are that the SD card can be no larger than 32 GB and there is no way to have photos  etc.  automatically saved to it. Therefore  when the phone's memory is getting full  I have to manually transfer photos  etc.  to the SD card. Overall though  this has been a good phone.\", 'I can not tell you how awful this phone is. it has a mind of its own. I would be happier with a flip phone than this ', 'Plz tell me its camera quality only plz', \"i will never get a zte again  it's awful!!!!! you can't hear on it  i accidently pressed the button for deaf and or blind person  now i can't access anything in my phone!!!\", \"Anonymous  06 Nov 2015Is there any special way you can turn the volume up maybe a little louder I found an app that has increased my volume very good it's called speakerboost on the App Store it works very well \", \"I transfered over from a galaxy s4 . first of all when I got it from a friend it was cracked front and back. It was just going to be a loaner phone until I got my Samsung fixed the lCD broke on the Samsung. I must have dropped this phone at least 5 times since hard. Dropped a few times in water.  This thing still works flawlessly. The battery life despite the huge screen is phenomenal way better than the S4 it seems to be faster than the S4 as well I've seen it sold on eBay for like 65 bucks comparing it to the Samsung I don't see why anybody would spend a million on the Samsung I haven't seen the Samsung do anything that this phone hasn't done only thing this phone lacks I think is NFC. A ZTE brand I believed had always been crap the phones seemed cheap. But no way not this one. I would drain the battery in the Samsung 2 times a day with the ZTE I go two days without charging it. okay I'm done.\", \"This has been the worst phone I've ever owned  hands down. I must say the battery life is good though.\", \"AnonD-326595  10 Jan 2015I wonder if there is a Lollipop update coming soon for this phone.Yes lollipop 5.1 download. 6.0 lollipop comes out in June. don't know if the max+ can do mulitiple O.S. though\", 'i foolishly was going to trade this phone in on an S6.   what a piece of crap the S6 is......always dying.     this phone stays charged and runs fast.    3200ma battery is the big plus.   the cam is 13 mp.   no down side.  super inexpensive.

After setting up everything  my first opinions are as follows: \\r\\nCONS: \\r\\n1. The phone tends to get hot very often  even while using the dialer to call someone. \\r\\n2. The battery was fully charged at 8:30 am and by 10:00 am it came down to 77% with medium usage  no gaming or cpu intensive work. The battery is definitely weak at 2300 mAh for a 5\" phone. \\r\\n3. Installed Jio4Gvoice app and tried to call someone; gets disconnected after a few seconds. This maybe because of Jio signal  but unfortunately the same SIM works flawlessly in other handsets. Keeps saying \"please check your internet connection\" even when the internet is connected. \\r\\n4. Screen brightness is quite low. For normal usage  the brightness control has to be set more than 50% to be able to see clearly even indoors. \\r\\n5. Camera quality is below standard; skin tones come  out dark and unnatural. Colour saturation is also low. \\r\\n6. Single SIM. \\r\\nPROS: \\r\\n1. Screen resolution is good  actual 1920X1080 pixels. \\r\\n2. Sound is okay. Mic sensitivity is okay. \\r\\n3. Good build  nice to handle. The back seems to be of glass  fragile. \\r\\n4.Dual colour flash. \\r\\nOverall  I don\\'t recommend this mobile phone. If I can\\'t make basic calls through Reliance Jio network  it is not of much use to me.

Rooted it  installed Google Play (gapps) and removed all ZTE bloatwares  and just installed my apps like Greenify  etc. to help with battery.  Here are some comments:\\n \\r\\nLTE/4G: Tested working in Taiwan and Singapore (both sim slots); though only 1 sim can be active at any time.  Signal reception (including Wifi) is acceptable though it is not the best.\\n \\r\\nCamera: Average only  Samsung Note 3 definitely better  iPhone 6/6+ way  way better  especially in low lights than this  ZTE still has a long  long way to catch up in this area.\\n \\r\\nScreen: Good  acceptable but colors not as good as Note 3 (personal preference).  However brightness control range is not as wide compared to LG G-Flex or Note 3 (testing using built-in control and Lux app).\\n \\r\\nBattery: Not bad but not so good either for a 4250mAh battery.  Main culprit I suspect is the screen sucking too much juice. I have to use a few apps to kill background services  etc. but mostly it can last a day for me (12hrs - 16hrs) though I expected much more.\\n \\r\\nGPS: A bit slower and less accurate compared to LG G-Flex and Note 3 (running Waze).\\n \\r\\nBuilt Quality: Good BUT a tiny screw on the left side dropped out! Now I got a hole on a brand new phone...  Still some way to go for ZTE to improve on this.\\n \\r\\nSize: I\\'ve used Note  Note 2 and Note 3 & LG G-Flex so this is expected.  6.4\" is not too big for me and it fits into my back pocket nicely. In fact this is 1 of the main reasons I got this phone!\\n \\r\\nLast but not least there\\'s some quirks that changes setting that I can\\'t seem to explain. Eg. I set phone to go Sleep profile from 23:00 - 07:00 and it works.  However after I turn off it still goes to silent (but not Sleep profile)! Weird!  Sometimes Sync will be turned off by itself also.  I only set my phone to read from Google contact list but this phone sometimes will show Skype contact list by itself! Still trying to figure out what\\'s happening.\\n \\r\\nConclusion: You need to root the phone to get Google Play  Google apps  etc. If you are not comfortable with this then don\\'t get this phone.  Also camera performance is not as good and it\\'s bugging me as I need to carry another phone to take good pics  another major let down.  Now I\\'m looking to replace it with another better dual sim  probably the branded ones from LG  Sony or Samsung  etc. No doubt the Chinese can put all the highest specs hardware but the execution and finesse is still 1 or 2 generations behind the competitors.', 'Does it include the google play store?', 'big space... but y no coming malaysian market', 'AnonD-293427  12 Aug 2014I just got the phone last week after waiting four months on a waiting list in shenzhen.

Weirdly when the phone on heavy use  this metal border become very hot. \\r\\nSecond  the UI. \\r\\nThe UI installed in the phone is very bad  no Google Play and not feature rich. \\r\\nThird  Camera testing. \\r\\nFor outdoor shooting with adequate light  the camera was superb but at night  it was the opposite. Almost can't capture anything without light. I don't know if this are caused by the UI or hardware defect. \\r\\nFourth  performance. \\r\\nOverall this phone runs smooth almost lag free and without any sign of throttling. The Snapdragon 800 clocked at 2 15 Ghz. \\r\\nFifth  battery life. \\r\\nThis is the one that impress me the most. Like one said  do not judge the book by the cover.

Not because it broke by falling  but it just started to click on stuff that I didn't want. The second one wouldn't work on half the screen  but still clicked on stuff  and called people  by pressing call. I touched it somewhere and it would click somewhere else. This wast the most frustrating part. The second was the very very very very shitty camera. Apart from braking down  and freezing all the time  it was a useful phone. \\r\\nPros: -Great battery life  after one year  still holds 3 days. \\r\\n          -Pretty fast for it's price. When working well  it's faster then 2 year old flagships. \\r\\n          -Fast web browsing  good interface  not too much bloatware. \\r\\n          -Good signal strength. \\r\\nCons: -It has the reliability of an old Alfa Romeo. \\r\\n           -Both cameras are the worst I've ever seen  meybe the Sony Ericcson T300 was worse in 2004 :) \\r\\n           -Digitizer started a different life after a while. The first one was original  and started to misbehave. I bought 2 new ones from ebay. The first one worked great  for 3 months  but I dropped it and broke. It was still working better then the previous one  and the next one.  \\r\\n          In my opinion you should only buy this phone  if you like fixing things  or want to keep it no more than a year  or 6 months to be safe :)\", \"How to root the sd card?

Effectively ¬£45 (¬£60 at Argos  but inc ¬£10 airtime and ¬£5 Argos voucher) and I think that's great value.

The stuff I actually need the phone for  ie calls  texts  Twitter  bits and pieces of browsing and taking a few snaps  it does with ease.\\n \\r\\nFeels nicer than I'd expected in my hand considering the price. Solid construction  doesn't creak when flexed and has a nice weight to it.

Again  for stuff like Twitter  listening to music and 2D gaming  it's absolutely fine.

Dials random numbers in the phonebook on the sim (that it won't display) in the middle of the night all on its own. Maybe ok for kids who want to play games on it and take endless photos  but no good for me.

I sometimes get okay pictures  but was surprised to learn it has 8 Megapixels for the camera  it really does not seem like 8 megapixels  the pictures come out lower quality and blurry if taken further away. It is an okay camera  but I would not recommend if your a Instagram junkie and love taking photos like me! I also have trouble with storage  I have to erase many photos clear cache and data daily to keep the phone running up to par. If your on top of your game and can handle that as a daily task  then this phone is for you. I keep it because it has not let me down as it is built very sturdy  my screen began cracking last year and it is still in a good condition to use as the spidering of the glass crack seems to be happening at a slow rate  so I love the screen  like I said this cell phone is sturdy and will not let you down.

Firefox 1.1 has been out for two months  nothing from ZTE  no support from Mozilla  unofficial builds of 1.1 by third parties may _brick_ the phone. This is NOT a good start for FirefoxOS. As a developer  I am supposed to be the target demographic for this phone  but ZTE's lack of updates is concerning. Save your $$$  get the Geeksphone  or the LG Fireweb instead.\", 'I don\\'t mind the low specs for a low price  but the huge radius on the rounded corners and the lifeguard orange colour are so ugly. I\\'d like to have more colour choices and a more \"blocky\" look.', \"Just gave the ZTE Open a test run with an eye  or should I say EAR  to performance.  When it comes to screens and swipe functionality  etc. let's face it  a smartphone is a smartphone.  We figure stuff out.  What we can't learn to live with is bad audio quality.\\n \\r\\nTHANKFULLY  this phone passes audio quality spec tests (hooked it up to some Sony monitoring gear I use in broadcast work  spec against an Apple iPhone 5 and older model Sony Ericsson Experia S12 I have lying around).  Not too bad!  Wouldn't recommend the LTE Open as a studio music recorder/player  but noise levels are fairly low and the fidelity works for casual listening.  Next step: The Club test  running tracks in place of the iPhone we use now!\\n \\r\\nRaggles   \\r\\nSan Francisco\", \"It's impossible to write a review of this phone without finding what you are really reviewing is Firefox OS.\\n \\r\\nThe hardware  like the specifications suggest  is adaquate. Like a smart yet bored C student  the phone passes  but you can tell  the OS gives hints of a quiet brilliant potential inside. Battery life is average. The screen is average. The camera is average. The speaker and microphone are average. In this since the phone is barely worth reviewing in that the charts above have already told you what you need to know.\\n \\r\\nBut then we come to the Operating System. This is what is different. This is what has a few geeky souls going against their specification-addled brains to buy this average phone. So let's get on with that.\\n \\r\\nThe phone ships with version 1.0. There is a 1.1 update that addresses speed but you'll have to wait until ZTE pushes that out. As it is  there is minimal lag with version 1.0 on this device.\\n \\r\\nThe Phone and texting functionality work well as expected.\\n \\r\\nUnless an app is using it  WiFi turns off when the device goes to sleep. This is annoying as I don't have a data plan but spend 90% of my day sitting next to a wireless router. This means to see if I have gotten any new email  I must wake the device  wait for the WiFi to connect  start the email app  and then refresh the app  and then scroll to the top to see any new messages.\\n \\r\\nThe built-in email application does what is supposed to do. It does not follow the threaded  conversation style formatting that gmail uses  however. So if you have a long conversation going the text gets pretty small so it can fit in all of the replies.\\n \\r\\nThe music player works. It tries to be smart about it and displays artists as tiles that you scroll through. Lag is mostly apparent here if your music collection is huge.\\n \\r\\nThe Firefox OS Marketplace is mostly a bare cupboard. But this is inherent for any new mobile operating system. This ecosystem hasn't bloomed yet  and will not ever be like iTunes or the Google Play store  but I have the feeling something will become of it.\\n \\r\\nInternet browsing turned out to be surprisingly flaky. One would assume if the OS is named after your flagship browser  it ought to work well on the mobile side as well as the desktop side. Sites like realtor.com and tripadvisor don't really work. Other sites don't yet recognize the brower as a mobile one  so you end up zooming a lot.\\n \\r\\nAll in all  this phone is priced right at $80. Firefox OS is immensly promising and as long as ZTE rolls out updates in a timely manner  the Open is a perfect vessel to enjoy being part of this new ecosystem as it grows. \\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Able to access web sites but can't go any deeper within those sites.  For example  Realtor.com  then try to enter search perimeters and it's a no-go.  Dead in the water.  Very frustrating.

I mucked around with the phone last night and unsuccessfully tried to update it. Anyhow  I gave up  and decided that I'd have to get a new phone. I even put a bid in on Ebay for a good second-hand phone.\\n \\r\\n(2) Today I went shopping  rang my wife  and noticed that 3G was active on the VirginMobile SIM which previously had refused go into 3G mode. I opened the browser  and the internet worked perfectly!!!!\\n \\r\\n(3) In my review  I said that the SIM2 slot didn't receive SMSs. I again sent an SMS to the Aldimobile card in that slot  and nothing happened. But two and a half hours later  the SMS arrived. So I can't now say that the second slot doesn't receive SMSs.\\n \\r\\n(4) Anyhow  this means that I can now keep the phone after all  as what I originally wanted it for that my old phone didn't have was 3G. \\r\\nRegards.\", 'This is ZTE KIS LITE  i have this phone almost 2 years and work fine  never have any defect', \"(1)I am disappointed with my ZTE V790 with Android 2.3.0. \\n \\r\\n(2)Firstly  it often reboots itself - more often after I've been on Playstore and downloaded something. Other times  I see it becoming sluggish after I've been adjusting something in Settings  Then I come back to it later and have to enter my Sim card codes after it has rebooted itself.\\n \\r\\n(3)Secondly  while I can get 3G to work well with my Lebara SIM card on the Vodafone network  I can only get 2G with my Virginmoble SIM card on the Optus network  and 2G on my Aldimobile on the Telstra network ( I know how to input APN settings). when I do get the 3G to appear for Virginmobile  the phone and internet for that Sim card doesn't work  but it works fine for 2G. However  when I then put the Aldimobile SIM in my bigger Lenovo A916 phone  it has no problem getting 4G.\\n \\r\\n(4)Thirdly  I thought I had solved my issues by putting the Lebara SIM into Slot1  and the VirginMobile SIM into Slot2. But then I found I wasn't receiving SMSs in my Virginmobile SIM (which is my main card). When I moved the Virginmobile SIM card to Slot 1  then it did receive SMSs.\\n \\r\\n(5)Maybe my problem arises because all my SIM cards use other main carriers' networks. I have no way to know  but I do know that I've had no such issues when using those SIM cards in my Medion and Lenovo phones.\\n \\r\\n(6)On the other hand  if your SIM card does deliver good 3G in the phone like my Lebara one does  and the dual SIM feature isn't a big deal for you  you may well be pretty satisfied with this phone. \\r\\nRegards.\", 'One network work in my ZTE V790  he is locked for others networks  what i can do ?

And couldn't get some of the Apps that I wanted because of the Android Version wasn't New Enough! I think if they would Update the Android Version on this phone to a Newer one... That it wouldn't surely be as plagued with problems that it does have. But that's just my personal opinion! Good phone for the price! But still leaves you wanting more in the end. But just like everything else... You pretty much get what you pay for! My Overall Rating of this phone would be around a 7 out of 10!

The camera locks the phone up and the battery has to be removed to get it to unlock. Upon updating it automatically switches to LTE/CDMA which will suck your data VERY FAST because it puts my phone as a HOT SPOT!!! Techs can't figure that one out. I have to keep it on CDMA only.

The shocking thing is it has 4GB of internal memory and anyone who wants to store more personal things they can insert SD card upto 32GB. Overall the phone is too good for a price.

The only downsides are the front camera and the battery life! i use my phone constantly  and i have to charge it about 2-3 times a day (including overnight).

It's worth the money!\", 'Great device with good features easy to use and best call quality Price is great compare to other phone with same features Great looking  Timeline feature is great if you like facebook This phone was very easy to setup the mobile internet connection Great photos Crystal clear calls Another feature is that you can see flash content on web pages  like watching NBA videos.Final: i spend hours looking for the perfect unlocked phone and for the money this phone was the best that i found.

It\\'s the same price as the Samsung Admire and even though the design on the Score M looks a bit cooler  if price is the issue definitely go with the Admire.

I have had personal experiance with this product. The only video on this phone is on a 2\" screen. And can not be viewed satisfactory. The keyboard keys are very hard to see  and use. The pictures from the camera are the best feature of the phone. Calls are dropped often.

The picture quality is nice. But there isn\\'t any sound to the videos. The volume for the phone its self is very poor. You can not hear the party  you are talking to nor can they hear you very well either. The reception is poor & the phone will frequently drop calls.Personally I would not recomend this phone. I give it a Zero rating.', 'i suggest you can have a try with ZTE update tool. you can log in their official website zte.com.cn  and you can find the software under technical support.\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nI hope it can help you solve your problem.\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nenjoy your use.', \"I just purchased this phone from cricket and thought I would shed some light. \\r\\nIt's not a smart phone but a texting phone with some nice extras. I like the design and functions of the handset. Though the keys are small and you will need to keep your thumbnails at a length that is manageable to text at or it will be difficult to press the keys accurately  as with all qwerty key pad phones. The phone has a good feel to it and everything is of average quality except the back plate where the battery goes  it's very thin and you will need a protector. Service is good through cricket i'm in south Texas by the way and no service complaints as of yet. Screen resolution and functions make this a nice texting phone  it has a 2 mp camera with video capability. Pics and video are about what you expect. just like all the rest  good enough to use but will not win a photography award. All things considered  this is a nice texting phone at a good price.\", 'Aljafari  22 Dec 2011Any OS ?No bob its not an operating sys Phone', \"I bought this phone yesterday and I want to take it back.

The phone constantly needs you to interact with it through multiple menu screens to find otherwise common options and requires the user to \"hold it\\'s hand\" instead of being intuitive. The only impressive thing about the OS is how far backwards it manages to go  it feels like searching for settings on an old flip-phone.', \"Ive had my ZTE Tempo for maybe 3 months and i've noticed that the bottom half of the screen is very flimsy  just pressing on it a bit well make it warp. Also it has almost NO battery life  it virtually dies overnight if its not charging  also sometimes when im texting the keyboard will just de-activate and it leaves me unable to do anything. Would not recommend  4/10\", 'I love mii ztee', 'its sucks it frustrating very bad phone', 'I have been using cellphones since they became available in Nebraska.  My first one was a Motorola which worked fine till I dropped it off a roof on a const. site.  My next was a LG which I used forever  survived washing machines  const. sites and time.  Finally died.

Once I have stopped ringing myself on an hourly basis I will retreive the phone and write a more detailed review.', 'xerox copy of samsung corby', \"Christ  I can't express my admiration for this phone in mere words. It would take at the very least an orchestral movement backed up by interpretive dance. AT THE VERY LEAST! The touch screen is supple and as responsive as any I have ever stroked. The brightly coloured backs are a neon delight. It doesn't just LOOK the part  it backs it up with sheer scientific brilliance. Never mind that you'll have to return it after two weeks: those two weeks will be the happiest of your life. Enjoy them while you can!!! I LOVE YOU LISBON. Sexy city; sexy phone.\"]",

I like the separate 3.5 audio jack at the bottom (headphones included in my version); the micro USB jack can be used with two cables  mains plug power and regular-size USB data  also included. I believe they'll charge with the USB cable if the data connection is declined.\\n \\r\\nThe screen is small but pretty nice  and there is also a white LED lantern at the top edge - it turns on or off with a long press on the 0 key (but only on the main screen  not in menus). The FM radio requires the headphones to be plugged in. The overall feel in your hand is OK  and the keys work well enough.\\n \\r\\nI bought these on behalf of an aunt for a Christmas gift - she was asking how I'd gotten such nice phones for so little money ... I agree  they have a may have a few not-so-perfect points  but are extremely good value.\\n \\r\\n(Oh  phone calls? I suppose so  it rings ;-)\\n\", \"Apparently this phone has no java but I'm browsing this site via opera mini for the default browser display some sites in chinese.
